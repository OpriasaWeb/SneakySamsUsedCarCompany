# Sneaky Sam's Used Car Company

A. Sneaky Sam's Used Car Company provides car loans to customers at 2 percent interest per month. Design an application that gets customer data, including an account number, customer name, and purchase price. Output the account number and name, then output the customer's projected balance each month for the next 24 months. Assume that when the balance reaches $25 or less, the customer can pay off the account. At the beginning of every month, 2 percent interest is added to the balance, and then the customer makes a payment equal to 1/24 of the current balance.

B. Modify the car payment application so it executes continuously for any number of customers until a sentinel value is supplied for the account number.
